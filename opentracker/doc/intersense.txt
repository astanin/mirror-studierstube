@page intersenseinstall InterSense Driver installation

The DLL included in this distribution provides an easy to use API that
can detect, configure and retrieve data from all models of InterSense 
trackers. A sample application is provided to illustrate the use of most
functions. See isense.h for explanations and function prototypes. Significant
portion of the API and the sample application is not relevant when used with
the InterTrax. 


COMPATIBILITY
Windows version supports all InterSense trackers. Irix and Linux is limited
to serial port models. USB support on Linux is planned for future releases.


IMPORTANT
When running InertiaCube2 on Linux and Irix platforms it is necessary to 
maintain a minimal call rate of the ISD_GetData function at 10Hz, otherwise
tracking quality can't be guaranteed.
