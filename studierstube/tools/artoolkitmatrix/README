The ARToolKit camera matrix (which is used in the
artoolkit2offaxis.m script to calculate the
SoOffAxisCamera parameters) is built up like this:

[ fcx 0.0 ccx ; 0.0 fcy ccy ; 0.0 0.0 1.0 ]

where fcx and fcy are the focal length and
ccx and ccy are the coordinates of the principal point.

This data can be directly taken from the MATLab camera
calibration toolbox results.

Alternatively, this tool allows reading an existing
ARToolKit camera file (both old binary and new ASCII
style) and outputs this matrix.
