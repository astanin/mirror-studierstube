This script calculates the parameters required
to setup an SoOffAxisCamera node in Studierstube.

To run this MATLab script, the camera's resolution
and intrinsic matrix has to be known.

Data for intrinsic matrix can be measured using
the MATLab camera calibration toolbox.

The matrix is built like this:

[ fcx 0.0 ccx ; 0.0 fcy ccy ; 0.0 0.0 1.0 ]

where fcx and fcy are the focal length and
ccx and ccy are the coordinates of the principal point.

If an ARToolKit camera file (both old binary or new ASCII
style) already exists one can use the artoolkitmatrix tool
to output this matrix.
